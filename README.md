# Breast Cancer Classification Project
# Introduction
This repository contains code for a breast cancer classification project. The goal of this project is to develop a 
machine learning model that can classify breast masses into two categories: Malignant and Benign. 
The model is trained on a breast cancer dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
Each sample in the dataset represents a breast mass, and the corresponding target variable indicates whether the mass is Malignant (1) or Benign (0).
Dataset Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following libraries:


Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

# Code Overview
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of exploration and visualization. The main steps of the code are as follows:

Data Loading: The breast cancer dataset is loaded using Scikit-learn's dataset module. The dataset is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is checked for any missing values, but fortunately, there are none. 
Data normalization is performed using the StandardScaler to bring all features to a similar scale.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics and visualizations are performed to gain insights into the dataset. 
The distribution of Malignant and Benign cases is also analyzed.

Model Selection: Logistic Regression is chosen as the classification algorithm for this project due to its simplicity and interpretability.
 Other classifiers like Decision Trees or Random Forests could also be considered for future experimentation.

Model Training: The logistic regression model is trained using the training data obtained from the train-test split of the dataset.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using various metrics such as accuracy.

Prediction: A sample input data point is provided to demonstrate how the trained model can predict whether the breast mass is Malignant or Benign.

# How to Use
To run the code and reproduce the results:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
Open the Jupyter Notebook breast_cancer_classification.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the code cells in the notebook to execute the project step-by-step.


# Future Improvements
Given more time, the following improvements could be considered:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters for the logistic regression model to optimize its performance.
Algorithm Exploration: Try other classification algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to see if they outperform logistic regression.
Feature Engineering: Explore domain-specific knowledge to create more informative features that might enhance the model's performance.
Model Interpretability: Employ techniques for model interpretability to understand how the model's decisions are influenced by different features.
